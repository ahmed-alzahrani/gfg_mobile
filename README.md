# gfg_mobile

This flutter application is to serve as both the native iOS and android
client in conjunction with the GFG-Webapp in order to facilitate charitable
donations from users based on real world soccer results.

## Getting Started

1. Users will need to install [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) on their machine,
this is Google's mobile app SDK for native applications.

2. Users will need to install the [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org) programming language

3. (Optional) If users wish to edit the code / extend the apps capabilities, best results
best results are achieved with one of the editor plugins offered by the Flutter team.
These are made for either [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) or
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Instructions for configuring
your editor can be found [here](https://flutter.io/get-started/editor/).

4. You will need the [Firebase config files](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)
to be added to your project on either Android, iOS, or both in order to offer the firebase
features on that platform. Please contact the author of this repository for said files.

5. As mentioned, this client communicates with the [GFG-Webapp](https://github.com/ahmed-alzahrani/GFG-Webapp)
backend. Launch that app (it automatically will launch locally on port 8080) and the client's communication
should automatically be configured.
